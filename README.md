# Collex Frontend
This is a testing ground for Collex's frontend built using ```create-react-app```.

Collex (a mash-up of Collections and Lexicon) allows users to create word collections based on their own categorization methods.

Writing a story that takes place during the winter? Collex allows you to search through a thesaurus, displaying multiple words
and their synonyms and antonyms at a time, so you are able to explore and save wintery-related words to your own collection.

## API Key
The application currently requires the use of [Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Thesaurus](https://dictionaryapi.com/products/api-collegiate-thesaurus).

See the ```src/.APIKey.js``` for information on how to setup the key.
